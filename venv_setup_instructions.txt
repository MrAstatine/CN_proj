# Virtual Environment Setup Instructions

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd c:/Users/cyber/OneDrive/Desktop/CN_proj
   ```
   Then, create a new virtual environment by running:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   After creating the virtual environment, you can activate it using the following command:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Verify Activation:**
   Once activated, your terminal prompt should change to indicate that the virtual environment is active. You can also verify by running:
   ```
   python --version
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**
   If you have a `requirements.txt` file, you can install the necessary packages using:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Follow these steps to set up and activate your virtual environment.
